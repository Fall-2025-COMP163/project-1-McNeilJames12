This project lets you create an RPG character, save it to a text file, load it back later, and level it up.
Each character has stats based on their class (like Warrior or Mage), and the program includes functions to create, display, save, load, and update the character.
It doesn’t use any extra libraries—just Python—and it includes a small demo so you can test it by running the file.
